This is a simple client-side blogging platform built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to register, log in, create blog posts, edit and delete their own posts, and add comments. The application uses LocalStorage to save users, posts, and comments, meaning all data is stored in the browser without needing a backend server or database.
